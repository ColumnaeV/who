                <h2>An Overview</h2>
                <p>I'm probably one of the kindest human beings you'll ever meet. Chivalry is key, but good manners suit most people. I enjoy just about anything really. I'm an honest lad, but you would still lose at Blackjack against me, or if you're old school, then Cribbage. Versatility is a good skill to have, but I really hate country music. Otherwise, I'm fine with any other genre of music, even Russian hip-hop. Competitive gamer turned компот (kompot) enthusiast. If you make it good, let me know.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 0;">Cheers,<br><br><i>Christian LS Nguyen</i></p>

                <h2>Studying to Become A Surgeon</h2>
                <p>This practise of medicine has been a focus of my life for quite some time. Although it may have not been my first choice for occupational study, it has been at the back of my mind from when I was a very young lad. Witnessing tramatic events at a young age combined with my desire to care for others has been slowly feuling my drive into the field of medicine. There are many ways in which a person can help a larger population in humanitarian aid, but by serving in an area where an individual is requiring immediate attention has interested me more. Ultimately, by knowing the individual I helped on a personal level is a satisfaction of life in which I strive to observe every day.</p>

                <h2>Continuing with Frontend Development</h2>
                <p>Even though my career interests lie elsewhere, I still find enjoyment in developing in frontend design. I see frontend design as a canvas of art, rather than a method of profit. Every website, graphical interface, and/or app demonstrates the developers creativity and ingenuity in digital art. For me, web-based coding was my limitless canvas that I could express my contemporary designs, ideas, and emotions. The reason why I decided to not pursue this area of expertise as a career is because I knew I would lose this as a hobby. Life should be enjoying what we love, regardless of how marketable it could be.</p>

                <h2>My Cup of Tea</h2>
                <p>It's said that you can tell what a person is like based upon what they drink. Considering that, I'm more of a tea person than a coffee person. That doesn't mean I wound drink coffee. On a very busy day, I'd like to enjoy a Dunkin' Donuts&reg; iced coffee with French vanilla and a hint of sugar. It's quite basic (I know). For leisure I prefer a variety of boba teas whilst enjoying a friendly conversation. To be honest, any type of traditional tea... is my cup of tea.</p>
